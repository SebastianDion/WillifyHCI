      Flash-flash, I'ma take the pictures for my fam, damn
      Show 'em I've made it
      Flashbacks to the pictures from way back
      The kids were like, "Who's that? Who's that?"
      Now I do Hollywood, yeah
      Copies everywhere like a walkie talkie
      I'ma run the lobby, speak to nobody
      San Gabriel Valley, I might crash your party, like
      Yeah, you made it, you've been anxious
      But you made it, California
      Conversations 'til the sunrise
      When you stop by, California
      I don't wanna be the one that's left behind
      I love the way you lie
      I don't wanna be the one to lose my mind
      I know you know
      Somebody put some brakes on me
      I really need rest on me
      Pops callin' up every couple days
      I'm smilin' so he could think I'm straight
      Why can't I tell the truth?
      Playin' J. Cole back then, with a clear end goal
      Like it all made sense, I needed myself
      And nobody else, okay, let's go, uh
      From how it looks, man, it's hard to complain
      Man, I just been prayin' that when I get older
      That I got some smile in me that can remain
      My money is long but I got some new issues
      That feel like as long as they government names
      Man, all I could wish is the mask that I wear
      And the face that's below it is lookin' the same, like
      (Oh, oh, oh) You been in this fight
      I can see it in your eyes, like
      (Oh, oh, oh) I made up my mind
      I don't wanna waste no time, yeah
      Money makin', while we're breakin'
      It's amazin', California
      Celebrate it or berate it
      It's been fated, California
      Oh, Maria, the hills are swarmin'
      With dead ends and the bots performin'
      Don't mistake it, you can break big
      'Til you get sick, hm
      Shut the fuck up, don't wake another neighbor (yeah, shut the fuck up)
      I don't know you and I don't want to later (later)
      Praying to God I never run out of His favor
      But we don't make the textbooks on our best behavior, do we?
      I'm the anti-hero in my own damn movie (movie)
      All my exes write songs that I'm based on, loosely
      Take after my ma, I can be choosy
      I can be choosy, oh
      And when the sky looks like a painting
      That's when you look down
      California

        lyrics: `I get no kick from champagne
          Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
          So tell me why shouldn't it be true?
          I get a kick out of brew
          There's only one beer left
          Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
          Tempt me, do a number on the label
          Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
          Like, "It's on me, put it on my tab, kid"
          However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron horse it
          You're leaving on your face, forfeit
          I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
          Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
          She told him, "Get off it", and a bunch of other more shit
          Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
          It's like he eating watermelon, stay spitting new seeds
          It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
          Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
          They group been soft
          First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
          He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
          She asked him autograph her derriere, it read
          "To Wide Load, this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
          Love, Villain"
          Take pride in code words
          Crooked eye, mold, nerd geek with a cold heart
          Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
          Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
          No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
          And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
          The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
          They call the super when they need their back, uh, plumbing fixed
          "How there's only one left? The pack comes in six!
          Whatever happened to two and three?"
          A herb tried to slide with four and five
          And got caught like, "What you doing, G?
          Don't make 'em have to get cutting like truancy
          Matter of fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!"
          Looser than a pair of Adidas
          I hope you brought your spare tweeters
          MCs sound like cheerleaders
          Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
          DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
          He do it for the smelly hubbies
          Seeds know what time it is like it's time for Teletubbies
          Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
          Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
          He plots shows like robberies
          In and out, one, two, three, no bodies, please
          Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
          The mic is the shotty, nobody move, nobody get hurt
          Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
          He came in the door, and "Everybody on the floor!"
          A whole string of jobs like we on tour
          Every night on the score, coming to your corner store
          There, it is done
          Now that the representative from South Africa has been
          Mind programmed
          All of the world leaders on Earth are under my control
          And when they meet tomorrow in special session
          I, DOOM, shall be voted "Master of the World"
          My plan is foolproof, but just in case
          And what about snow?
          Now, you keep your eyes open
          When I tell ya, start snappin' (Oh yeah, sure)
          Uh, ladies and gentlemen
          I am risking my life to tell you with, with great concern
          That I must warn you, I, I
          You must listen
          Many among you, have, have had their minds taken over
          DOOM, gosh, I wish I'd brought my autograph book

          You're weird
          Why is everyone staring at us?
          (Aw, I should have realized, we must look like freaks to them)
          Relax masseur, just do your thing

        desc: "Daniel reflects on his past relationship with his lover; she’s moved on, yet he wants things to stay the way they were. The contrast of perspectives on his relationships throughout the album shows his ever-maturing mindset. Although Caesar’s reminiscing shows growth, there is constant reminder to his previous lover that their love wasn’t just a feeling existing within a successful relationship, but continues on without fault even after their breakup. The song acts as a trauma-dump-esque song for listeners; a relatable song for anyone with a desired lover. Daniel tried to release this song during a listening party for his fans on Instagram Live, however, it was taken down for copyright.",

        desc: "Kill Bill” is the third single off of SZA’s sophomore full-length studio album, SOS. The harmonious murder ballad surrounds the topics of heartbreak and betrayal, resulting in SZA seeking revenge on her ex. The song’s production consists of a basic piano melody and a detuned, yet groovy rhythm. The song’s lyrics are composed of SZA’s homicidal tendencies towards her ex who crossed her — sharing a similar cadence to her previously released single, “Shirt” which is seen as the first part in the story as it surrounds her relationship pre-break-up. Furthermore, the title is an obvious reference to the iconic Kill Bill film duology directed by Quentin Tarantino as it shares the plot of revenge on an ex-lover.  Christian Breslauer, the director of the official music video followed the theme of the Kill Bill film as SZA plays the role of Beatrix “the Bride” Kiddo, the main character of the series. In the video, after being betrayed, SZA confronts the ex-lover and proceeds to tear his heart out. The video is also accompanied by several animated scenes, playing into film references.  An official remix to the track was released on April 14, 2023, with an additional verse from Doja Cat to increase song sales, pushing the track to the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100, marking SZA’s first chart-topper.",

        desc: "“Self Control” is a slow ballad that features Frank Ocean describing a relationship that is slowly falling apart. Throughout the song, Ocean hints the reason their relationship fell apart was because the other person was too immature. The song’s theme of self-control creates a tragic contrast to the control Ocean is unable to exert over his situation, illustrating a tension between self-control and external control. The intro features a high-pitched vocal effect Ocean uses throughout the album. The squeaky voice suggests Ocean is reminiscing about events that happened in his youth. Austin Feinstein, of the indie band Slow Hollows, and Yung Lean sing the choruses. Feinstein sings the first alone, with Yung Lean joining him on the second. During all of Ocean’s 2017 live shows, he performed an extended introduction to “Self Control” titled “Poolside Convo,” where he describes the poolside conversation between himself and his significant mentioned in the first line.",

He wants to break away and he needs his partner to let him go and allow him to leave. First teased by Daniel Caesar on his Instagram on February 6th 2023, then February 7th 2023, and finally the night before it released on February 9th 2023. Let Me Go was one of those songs where I was like, “I wanna take my career further.” Before I only went to the studio when I felt inspired, … and that was one of those sessions where it turned out good I guess",

      desc: "In “redrum,” 21 Savage returns to England with a new demeanor, marked by his street credibility. The instrumental combined with Savage’s lyricism establish a menacing mood, breaking in his third studio album, american dream. The title is a nod to the word “murder” spelled backward, simultaneously paying homage to the 1980 horror classic, The Shining, which initially coined the term. On top of this, the outro samples an infamous scene from the movie, further conveying the murderous theme. In UK Drill, “redrum” is a term associated with the conception of the genre, being first used by 67 in 2016 on “redruM Reverse.” One of the UK’s most respected artists, Skepta also referenced it with his 2019 single, “Redrum.”",

      I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
      Spent your life bein' hopeless
      Chokin' on insecurity
      I know all this is bad
      But, please, put a leash on me anyway
      Who needs self-esteem anyway?
      I hate myself to make you stay
      Push me away, I'll be right here
      With open, open, open, open arms (ooh)
      Open arms, you keep me open
      I'm so devoted
      You keep me open, open arms
      I'm so devoted to you, to you, to you
      No matter what come between us, yeah, I decided (ayy)
      I'm forever ridin' (whoa), you're forever guidin' (ayy)
      Pull up on an opp, hit his curb up, slide it (brr)
      Notice when you mad, ain't no words, just silence (ooh)
      You my favorite color, now you seein' every shade of me
      You say that I'm trippin', I hit back like, "Where you takin' me?"
      Locked in for life, on God, no replacin' me
      Consequences, repercussions, karma keep on changin' me
      For you I try, face card valid, ID
      C'est la vie, go to Paris, it ain't five-star, it ain't me
      Over-solid, keep it concrete, I'ma bet it on your whole fee
      Just don't switch sides, I could fire piece your wrist, AP
      Through the ups and downs and all the heat
      Take a turn and tell you what it be
      Backshots make you feel relief, anything, just don't you ever leave
      I guess I gotta go
      I guess it's time to go
      I gotta let you go
      (I'm so devoted)
      You keep me open
      Gotta let you go, gotta let you go
      I gotta let you go, I must
      You're the only one that's holdin' me down
      (You're the only one holdin' me down)
      ('Cause I'm the only one that's holdin' me down)

Later down HEROES & VILLAINS‘ tracklist, the two converge on “Around Me,” and sooner “I Can’t Save You (Interlude)” — also alongside Future.",

      For the East Coast, I'll double that

      On my wrist, new Cadillac

      These hoes wanna fuck my car (car)
      My dawg put a nigga in park
      Gotta watch out for the narcs, ayy

      desc: "“CARNIVAL” is an anthem guided by the chants of Inter Milan Ultra fans where ¥$, alongside Rich The Kid and Playboi Carti, stunt their riches and ensure their partners' sexual ability.  The track was initially titled “H00LIGANS” and previewed at the Las Vegas VULTURES Rave on December 15, 2023. The released version, featuring a new choir backing, instrumental, Ye verse, Carti verse, and an altered Rich The Kid verse, was debuted at the United Center in Chicago during VULTURES 1’s first official listening party. Ye samples his own song “Hell of a Life” due to the original Ozzy Osbourne sample not being cleared. Ozzy’s disproval was announced via an X outburst, which Ye has thought not to be written by Ozzy himself but instead a celebrity handler. The CARNIVAL PACK—featuring separate versions of CARNIVAL—was released in promotion of the track. It introduced a separate cover, and also propelled the track to the #1 spot on Billboard’s Hot 100 song chart.",
